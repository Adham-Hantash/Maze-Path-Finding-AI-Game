# Maze-Path-Finding-AI-Game
This is a maze path finding game implemented using the A* algorithm with the Manhattan heuristic. The game allows you to enter the start and end nodes of the maze, and add barriers using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Pygame library.
The game window will open, displaying a grid representing the maze. You can click on any empty cell to set it as the starting point. Similarly, you can click on another empty cell to set it as the end point. To add barriers, click on the desired cells to toggle them between open and blocked states.

Once the start and end points are set, you can click the "Find Path" button to start the A* algorithm and visualize the pathfinding process. The algorithm will search for the shortest path from the start to the end point, avoiding the barriers. The path will be displayed in a different color, and the algorithm's progress will be visualized in real-time.

Controls
Left-click: Set start point, end point, or toggle barrier cells.
Right-click: Clear the selected cell.
Credits
This game was developed using the Pygame library, which provides a simple and intuitive framework for building 2D games in Python. The A* algorithm with the Manhattan heuristic was used for pathfinding.

Special thanks to the creators and maintainers of the Pygame library for providing such a powerful and easy-to-use tool for game development in Python. Also, thanks to the authors of the A* algorithm for their contribution to pathfinding techniques.





User
write me a GitHub readme description about maze path finding AI game using A* algorithm that works with Manhattan pathfinding way where you can enter the start and end nodes and add barriers al on GUI made with pygame library
